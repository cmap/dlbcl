        p.mfc We are glad if you have found the CLUE data to be useful and would like to incorporate it into your publications. You do not need to include us as authors when you publish your CLUE analysis results. The only exception to this is a paper describing the overall contours of the LINCS dataset (i.e., the manuscript that we at the Broad are working on in collaboration with LINCS). If your paper needs a citation to our work on L1000 or LINCS, please contact us at clue@broadinstitute.org.
